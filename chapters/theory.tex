\section{Electronic Structure}
The problem of electronic structure methods begins with the attempt to solve the general non-relativistic time-independent Schr\"{o}dinger equation given as 
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:schrodinger}
        \hat{\mathcal{H}} \Psi = E \Psi
    \end{equation}
where $\hat{\mathcal{H}}$ is the Hamiltonian operator for a system of electrons, $\Psi$ is the electronic wavefunction and $E$ is the energy of the system. Consider a single electron in three dimensional system, the Schr\"{o}dinger equation can be expressed as 
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:1e_wave}
        \hat{\mathcal{H}} \Psi_n = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left(\pdv[2]{x} + \pdv[2]{y} + \pdv[2]{z} \right) \Psi_n + V \Psi_n  = \epsilon_n \Psi_n
    \end{equation}
where $m$ is the mass of electron, $V$ is the effective potential energy and $\epsilon_n$ is the energy of electron in the orbital. The term orbital denotes the solution of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a system of only one electron. This will be useful in later sections because this will allow to distinguish between the exact quantum state of a system of $N$ interacting  electrons 
from the approximate quantum state of $N$ electrons in $N$ orbitals, where each orbital is a solution to one-electron wavefunction in \eqref{eq:1e_wave}. If $V$ is zero for the case of free electrons (i.e. non-interacting), then the orbital model is exact. 
 
Since electrons are restricted by the potential inside the atom, the simplest way of solving \eqref{eq:1e_wave} is by considering an infinite potential well. The electrons are confined inside a cube of length $L$ where the potential $V$ inside is zero and infinite at outside must satisfy the boundary condition

\begin{equation}
	\Psi_n(L_x,L_y,L_z) = 0	
\end{equation}
where $L_x,L_y,L_z$ can be either 0 or $L$. The solution will have a sine dependence

\begin{equation}
	\Psi_n(x,y,z) = \sqrt{\left(\frac{2}{L}\right)^3} \ \sin(\frac{n_x \pi }{L} x) \sin(\frac{n_y \pi}{L} y) \sin(\frac{n_z \pi}{L} z)
\end{equation}
where $n_x,n_y,n_z$ are integer quantum states. Provided that $ k_i = n_i \pi / L$ where $i=x,y, \text{or}\, z$; then the energy dispersion relation can be expressed as 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:free_e}
    \epsilon_k = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} (k_x^2 + k_y^2 + k_z^2) = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} k^2 \propto k^2
\end{equation}
Note that energy levels are discretized by the quantum states which arises from imposing the boundary conditions. 
    \subsection{Electronic Band structure}
    Inside the crystal lattice, the periodic arrangement of atoms or ions causes the potential to be periodic which eventually gives rise to the formation of energy bands. The wavefunction $\Psi$ will become periodic in space with a period $L$ and must obey the Born-von Karman boundary condition 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:periodic}
    \Psi_k(x,y,z) = \Psi_k(x + L, y, z) 
\end{equation}
and similarly for the $y$ and $z$ coordinates. It can be shown that wavefunctions satisfying \eqref{eq:1e_wave} and \eqref{eq:periodic} are the Bloch form of a travelling plane wave
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Bloch}
    \Psi_k(\va{r}) = u_k(\va{r}) \exp(i \va{k} \vdot \va{r})
\end{equation}  
where $u_k(\va{r})$ has the period of the crystal lattice with $u_k(\va{r}) = u_k(\va{r} + \va{R})$. Here $\va{R}$ is the translation vector which can be simply thought as the periodicity expressed as vector.  The Bloch expression can be written as
\begin{align}
    \Psi_k(\va{r} + \va{R}) &= u_k(\va{r} + \va{R}) \exp(i \va{k} \vdot (\va{r} + \va{R}))  \notag \\
    \Psi_k(\va{r} + \va{R}) &= u_k(\va{r}) \exp(i \va{k} \vdot \va{r})  \exp(i \va{k} \vdot \va{R}) \notag \\
    \Psi_k(\va{r} + \va{R}) &= \Psi_k(\va{r}) \exp(i \va{k} \vdot \va{R}) 
\end{align}
Notice that the wavefunction differs from the plane wave of free electrons only by a periodic modulation given by the new phase factor. This means that the electrons in the crystal lattice are treated as perturbed weakly by the periodic potential of the ion cores.

%     k_i = \pm \frac{2n_i \pi}{L} \quad ; i = x,y,z \quad; n_i = 0, 1, 2, \dots
% \end{equation}

        \subsubsection{Band structure of free electron}
            A special case of periodicity is where the potential is set to zero, which is applicable for the free electrons. The wavefunction will be a plane wave 
            \begin{equation}
                \Psi_k(\va{r})  = \exp(i \va{k} \vdot \va{r})
            \end{equation} 
        that represents travelling wave with a momentum $\va{p} = \hbar \va{k}$. The energy dispersion relation is still given by \eqref{eq:free_e} but this time the allowed energy values are distributed essentially from zero to infinity. Figure \ref{fig:free-electron} shows the parabolic dependence of energy with the wavevector $k$. Since the system is periodic in real space, it must be true for the reciprocal space, in this case by $2\pi/a$ where $a$ is some lattice constant. Figure \ref{fig:free-electron}a shows the extended zone scheme where there are no restrictions on the values of wavevector $\va{k}$. When wavevectors are outside the first Brillouin zone (BZ), they can be translated back to the first zone by subtracting a suitable reciprocal lattice vector. In mathematical sense
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:band_fold}
            \va{k} + \va{G} = \va{k'}
        \end{equation}
        where $\va{k'}$ is the unrestricted wavevector, $\va{k}$ is in the first Brillouin zone, and $\va{G}$ is the translational reciprocal lattice vector. The energy dispersion relation can always be written as 
        \begin{align}
            \epsilon(k_x,k_y,k_z) &= \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} (\va{k}+\va{G})^2 \notag \\
                                &= \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}[(k_x + G_x)^2 + (k_y + G_y)^2 + (k_z + G_z)^2]
        \end{align}
        Figure \ref{fig:free-electron}b shows the reduced zone scheme where the  bands are folded into the first BZ by applying \eqref{eq:band_fold}. Any energy state beyond the first BZ is the same to a state inside the first BZ with a different band index $n$.

\subsubsection{Band structure of electrons in solids}
When atoms are very far from each other with no interaction, each electron occupies specific discrete orbitals such as 1s, 2p, 3d, etc. When they are bring  closer enough, the outermost (valence) electrons interact with each other and will result in the  energy level splitting. The innermost (core) electrons remain as they are, since they are closer to the nuclei and bounded by a deep potential well. For a solid containing a large $N$ atoms, there will be $N$ orbitals (i.e. $N$ 3d-orbitals) trying to occupy the same energy level. Pauli's exclusion principle will prevent this from happening, hence what happens is there will be splitting of the energy level and eventually forms a band. Figure \ref{fig:band_model} summarizes the evolution of energy levels as the atoms are brought together.

\begin{figure}[tbh!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{"images/band model"}
	\caption[Band structure in solids]{Formation of bands and band gaps when isolated atoms are bring closer together}
	\label{fig:band_model}
\end{figure}    

Another interesting property of band structure is the formation of energy band gaps. This happens when the valence electrons interact with the periodic potential of the nuclei. Assuming a weak periodic potential, most of the band structure will not changed very much, except possibly at the Brillouin zone boundaries with a wavevector of $\va{k} = n \pi/ a$. The orbitals with the wavevector at zone boundaries, chosen to be at high symmetry points, follows the Bragg diffraction condition and thus are diffracted. The valence electrons are scattered (or reflected) at the zone boundary in which the wavefunction are made up of equal plane waves travelling from the left and from the right. The wavefunction becomes a standing wave that resembles more of those bound states. Hence, there will be a forbidden region where travelling waves are not allowed. If sufficient energy is provided to the electron, they can overcome the  binding potential.
