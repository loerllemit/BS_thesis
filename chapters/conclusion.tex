\chapter{Conclusion} \label{chap:conclu}
Defects associated with Zn excess or O deficiency are expected to be donor types since the former introduces two available electrons to donate while the latter forms a dangling bond where lone electrons are in the Zn atom. Zinc atoms prefer to loose electrons to attain their cationic state. Hence, this defect type will form  positive charge states. On the other hand, defects associated with O excess or Zn deficiency are expected to be acceptor type defects. The excess \ch{O} atom will accept electrons to complete its electronic shell while deficient \ch{Zn} atom will cause a shortage of electrons hence  dangling bonds will form in the neighboring O atoms. O atoms prefer to accept electrons to attain their anionic state.
This defect type will form  negative charge states. Hence, oxygen vacancy, zinc interstitial, and zinc antisite were shown to be donor-type defects based on the bandstructure calculations done in this study. On the other hand, zinc vacancy, oxygen interstitial, and oxygen antisite were shown to accept-type defects. 

Oxygen vacancy,  zinc interstitial and zinc antisite cannot be responsible for the observed unintentional $n$-type conductivity in wurtzite ZnO since they have high defect formation energies. However, they can serve as a potential source of hole compensation in  $p$-type material since they have low formation energies.
