1) Edit Bandstructure of -1 Zinc vacancy near the valence band. The fermi level does not match in DOS plot  (adjusted)
2) add geometric relaxations (no more time)

4) explain n-type conductivity and nonstoichiometry and add references (will make discussion complicated)
5) add Oxygen interstitials explanation (done)
6) add Eq. when referencing equations  (not needed. will make the page more cluttered)
## layouts errors
1) code annotations have a line near the page border (corrected)
