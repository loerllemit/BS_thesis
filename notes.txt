1) Edit Bandstructure of -1 Zinc vacancy near the valence band. The fermi level does not match in DOS plot 
2) add geometric relaxations
3) add dft parallelization in software implementation 
4) explain n-type conductivity and nonstoichiometry and add references

## layouts errors
1) subsubsection has no numbers
2) decimal points  in convergence results are too large
