This thesis studied the key properties of native point defects in wurtzite ZnO, such as  defect energetics, electronic band structure and density of states evaluated via first principle calculations using Density Functional Theory (DFT). All calculations were done using the open source Quantum ESPRESSO software. Hubbard-U correction scheme was applied to correct the inherent band gap underestimation of standard DFT calculations. Results showed that
